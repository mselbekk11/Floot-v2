I want you to help me improve this Discover section

I want there to be 4 tiles that items are mapped over. 

Each item should be a project that floot is showing to their users. I want each tile to 

- have a big image at the top
- underneatht the image i want it clear so the background comes through
- i want the bottom to be split into 2 sections. On the left their is a logo taking full height and the title of the project and description to be ontop of each other - and inline with the logo. On the right hand side i want a love icon whith numbers next to it representing how many people have liked it. Image attached. For now use the image /Users/morgan/projects/floot/public/trizzy.png for all the images and make it easy for me to update
