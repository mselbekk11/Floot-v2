i want you to create me a new features section. I currently have: /Users/morgan/projects/Floot-2/components/feature-base.tsx

but i want it differnet. 

Please create a new file called feature-two.tsx - inside this i want 3 components. Each component holds 2 containers. One side is a text area consiting of 

- h2 using font-bricolage-grotesque
- p using geist 
- and create a new button variant within @button.tsx which looks like the button attached in the image (including drop shadow)

on the other side should be a container with a dropshadow and border which contains a video. 

there should be 3 instances of the above stacked together. However the middle ones text and video box should be swapped. 

I need this to be mobile responsive and they all stack ontop of each other like this 

text
video
text
video
text
video

(remember because the mioddle one is flipped, need to address that in the stacking of the components.)

I want this container to have a max-w-5xl and i want it also to have a py-12 md:py-30

the urls for the videos are here:
